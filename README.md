# Git Assignment - Hossein-Bg
----------------------------------------

a. What is an issue?
Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, feature requests, and more.
For more info please check the issues section on the repo.

----------------------------------------

b. What is a pull request?
PR serves as a proposal to merge changes made in one branch of a repository into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.

----------------------------------------

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
1. Fork the Repository
This create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account similar to how we did it for the shell assignment.
2. Use the git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.command to clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch with git checkout -b 'Branch name' command.
4. Make the necessary changes to the code or documentation in your new branch.
5. Push the branch to your GitHub repository.
6. Open a Pull Request by going to the repository page on GitHub where you pushed your branch. You will see a banner with a Compare & pull request button. Click on it, or go to the Pull requests tab and click New pull request.
7. Fill Out the Pull Request Form and submit the pull request.

----------------------------------------

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
1. Sign in to your GitHub account, then navigate to the git-assignment repo.
2. Open the repo and click the Setting tab, which is located at the top of the page.
3. In the left sidebar, under Access, click on Collaborators to open the collaborators management page. (you have to enter your GitHub pass to enter to the collaborators management page)
4. Click the Add people and enter the GitHub Username, Full name or email address of the person you want to add as a collaborator, then click the add button. (Here I added Simeon as a collaborator for my git-assignment but I am not sure if he will accept my invitation or not.) 
5. After accepting the invitation, your collaborators can push changes to the reop.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that allows programmers or developers to manage and keep track of changes in their code. On the other hand, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
